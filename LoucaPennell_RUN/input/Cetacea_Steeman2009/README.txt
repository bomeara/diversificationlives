This Cetacea phylogeny and timetree were created by:
  Steeman et al. (2009). Radiation of Extant Cetaceans Driven by Restructuring of the Oceans. Systematic Biology. 58:573â€“585.

The tree provided by Steeman on TreeBASE is actually just a taxonomy, not a phylogeny or timetree.

The actual timetree was downloaded from here:
